git diff master

   << compare all branched files to the master

git diff branchname

   << compare master files to those in a branch

git checkout branchname filename(s)

   << selective merge from a branch:

git diff master branchame -- filename 

   << compare the master version of 'filename' to that of branch 'branchname'

git diff HEAD^ HEAD

   << compare stuff from before the last commit

git diff HEAD~2 HEAD~1

   << compare stuff from second last commit

git checkout master
git merge branchname

   merge branchname into master

git checkout branchname
git rebase master

   rebase branchname (forked from master)

git rebase -i HEAD~3
   edit the commit messages for the last three commits.  Want to do this for 'git svn --interactive dcommit'
   if multiple commits were uses.  git-svn + lzlabs hooks require the Jira issue to be in the commit message for
   all commits that are applied.

   See:

      http://stackoverflow.com/a/25178676/189270

   for additional instructions.  short answer is change 'pick's to 'r' and edit editor, which will bring up the editor
   for all the previous selected commits.

   Update: looks like squash is what is desired for all but the last commit, and that last commit must have the 
      JIRA issue ID.

   Created: gitsvnsquash to do this process.

git merge-base Werror master

   base for the branch Werror relative to master

git svn show-ignore >> .git/info/exclude 

   ignore all the same things that svn ignores.

for i in `cat ../branches/Werror/l` ; do echo $i `git log -n 3 $i | grep Author | sed 's/Author: //;s/ .*//'` ; done 

   look for the who is changing things.
   However, this doesn't work well from a git svn repo that doesn't have enough history for the file.


from the clang svn page:

   The git-svn metadata can get out of sync after you mess around with branches and dcommit. When that happens, git svn dcommit stops working, complaining about files with uncommitted changes. The fix is to rebuild the metadata:

   % rm -rf .git/svn
   % git svn rebase -l


git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

   use diff3 conflicts by default.  This doesn't appear to be the case with git-svn ... or is it just because this is an old git
   installation?
